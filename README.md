# Eman ƒåiƒçku≈°iƒá | Cloud & Data Engineer

**Mission: To build and automate production-grade, zero-trust cloud infrastructure that is secure, scalable, and cost-efficient by default. I specialize in GCP, Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform, and event-driven serverless architectures.**

### üöÄ Engineering Case Studies: From Problem to Production

The following are curated examples of my work, demonstrating my ability to solve complex technical challenges and deliver measurable results.

| Case Study | Key Metric & Business Impact | Technologies Used |
|---|---|---|
| **[Real-Time Serverless Data Pipeline &rarr;](https://github.com/eman-cickusic/Real-Time-Serverless-Data-Pipeline-on-Google-Cloud)** | **`>60%` Reduction in Query Costs** <br/> Achieved via BigQuery optimization, saving projected thousands in annual operational spend. Processed `1,000+` events/sec with `<2s` end-to-end latency. | `GCP` `Terraform` `Pub/Sub` `Cloud Functions` `BigQuery` |
| **[End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline &rarr;](https://github.com/eman-cickusic/Secure-Software-Delivery)** | **`100%` Automated CVE Blocking** <br/> Created a zero-trust pipeline that cryptographically signs and validates all container images, automatically preventing vulnerabilities from reaching production. | `Cloud Build` `Binary Authorization` `Artifact Registry` `KMS` |
| **[Zero-Touch GCP CI/CD Framework &rarr;](https://github.com/eman-cickusic/gcp-cicd-demo)** | **`-85%` Reduction in Deployment Time** <br/> Reduced manual deployment processes from over 30 minutes to a fully automated average of `4m 15s`, increasing developer velocity and eliminating configuration drift. | `GitHub Actions` `Terraform` `Cloud Run` `Docker` `Shell` |
